Evaluation of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) devices as a security measure in Internet of Things systems at the physical layer level.
This research explores the potential of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enhance security in Internet of Things (IoT) systems at the physical layer.
By leveraging the flexibility and reconfigurability of FPGAs, this study investigates the design and implementation of security mechanisms directly at the hardware level, 
aiming to mitigate vulnerabilities and protect against physical attacks targeting IoT devices and networks. The research will encompass a comprehensive evaluation of 
FPGA-based security solutions, assessing their effectiveness in addressing various threats, such as side-channel attacks, tampering, and unauthorized access. Additionally,
the study will analyze the performance impact of implementing FPGA-based security measures on IoT devices, considering factors like power consumption and computational overhead.
The ultimate goal is to provide insights and recommendations for utilizing FPGAs as a robust security measure at the physical layer of IoT systems, contributing to the development
of more resilient and secure IoT infrastructure.
